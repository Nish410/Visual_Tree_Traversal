Visual Tree Traversal
A dynamic and interactive web application designed to visualize the operations and properties of various tree data structures. This tool provides a clear, step-by-step explanation of how Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and Splay Trees function, making complex concepts easy to understand.

Features
Multiple Tree Types: Explore and interact with:

1. Binary Search Tree (BST): Basic tree operations with ordered nodes.

2. AVL Tree: Self-balancing BST that maintains height balance using rotations.

3. Red-Black Tree: Self-balancing BST that ensures balance through node coloring and rotations.

4. Splay Tree: Self-adjusting BST that moves frequently accessed nodes to the root.
